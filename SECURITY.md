# Security Policy

## Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

**Do not open public issues for security vulnerabilities.**

If you discover a security vulnerability in LocalML finetune, please report it to the maintainers privately.

### How to Report

**Email**: [security@example.com]

Include:
- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce (if possible)
- Potential impact
- Suggested fix (if you have one)

### Response Timeline

- **Acknowledgment**: Within 48 hours
- **Assessment**: Within 1 week
- **Fix**: Depends on severity
- **Disclosure**: Once patch is available

## Security Best Practices

### For Users

**In Production:**
1. Keep dependencies updated
2. Use strong, unique passwords
3. Enable HTTPS/TLS
4. Implement rate limiting
5. Use environment variables for secrets (not .env files in repo)
6. Enable database backups
7. Monitor logs for suspicious activity
8. Use network firewalls
9. Keep systems patched

**Never:**
- Commit secrets to git
- Expose API keys in logs
- Use default credentials
- Skip security checks
- Run with unnecessary permissions

### For Developers

1. **Input validation** - Always validate user input
2. **SQL injection prevention** - Use parameterized queries (SQLAlchemy does this)
3. **Authentication** - Implement proper JWT validation
4. **Authorization** - Check permissions before operations
5. **Encryption** - Use HTTPS, encrypt sensitive data at rest
6. **Secrets management** - Use environment variables or secrets manager
7. **Dependency updates** - Keep packages current
8. **Code review** - Have peers review security-sensitive code
9. **Testing** - Write tests for security boundaries
10. **Logging** - Log security events without exposing sensitive data

## Known Security Considerations

### Current Implementation

**Strong Points:**
- ✅ JWT authentication with expiration
- ✅ Role-based access control (RBAC)
- ✅ Password hashing with bcrypt
- ✅ SQL injection prevention via ORM
- ✅ Database encryption support
- ✅ CORS configuration
- ✅ API rate limiting support
- ✅ Audit logging

**Areas for Production Hardening:**
- ⚠️ Enable HTTPS enforcement
- ⚠️ Implement DDoS protection
- ⚠️ Add Web Application Firewall (WAF)
- ⚠️ Enable security headers (CSP, X-Frame-Options, etc.)
- ⚠️ Implement request signing for admin endpoints
- ⚠️ Set up intrusion detection
- ⚠️ Regular security audits and penetration testing

### Dependencies

This project uses 35+ external packages. We regularly:
- ✅ Scan for vulnerabilities
- ✅ Keep dependencies current
- ✅ Review security advisories
- ✅ Monitor GitHub security alerts

Check the [dependency list](sentinel-cloud-vision/requirements.txt) for versions.

## Security in CI/CD

**GitHub Actions:**
- Runs automated tests
- Checks code quality
- Scans for common vulnerabilities
- Verifies no secrets are committed

**Best Practices:**
- Use branch protection rules
- Require reviews before merge
- Run security checks automatically
- Don't store secrets in CI/CD configuration

## Data Protection

### At Rest
- Database encryption (RDS default)
- S3 encryption (default)
- Filesystem encryption (recommended)

### In Transit
- HTTPS/TLS for all connections
- CORS configuration
- Request validation

### Retention
- Define retention policies
- Regular backup verification
- Secure deletion procedures

## Compliance Considerations

This project is designed to support:
- ✅ GDPR compliance (data privacy)
- ✅ HIPAA compliance (healthcare, with configuration)
- ✅ SOC 2 compliance (with proper deployment)
- ✅ PCI DSS (with proper configuration)

For compliance-specific deployments, implement additional controls:
- Audit logging
- Access controls
- Encryption
- Regular security assessments

## Security Roadmap

**Short Term (Next Release):**
- [ ] Add security headers middleware
- [ ] Implement request signing for sensitive endpoints
- [ ] Add rate limiting middleware
- [ ] Security documentation improvements

**Medium Term:**
- [ ] Zero-trust architecture support
- [ ] Encryption key rotation
- [ ] Advanced threat detection
- [ ] Third-party security audit

**Long Term:**
- [ ] Bug bounty program
- [ ] Security certification (SOC 2, ISO 27001)
- [ ] Advanced compliance features

## Responsible Disclosure

We follow responsible disclosure practices:

1. **Notification** - We notify users of vulnerabilities
2. **Timeline** - We provide time to patch before public disclosure
3. **Credit** - We credit security researchers (with permission)
4. **Fix Quality** - We ensure patches are thoroughly tested
